- Overview, Understanding the Problem, and Getting the Data : get a clear grip on the problem at hand and begin working with the dataset.

- Exploratory Data Analysis and Modeling : milestone report for deliverable.

- Prediction Model : build, evaluate and improve prediction model.

- Creative Exploration : improve the predictive accuracy while reducing computational runtime and model complexity.

- Data Product : develop the first component of the final data product.

- Slide Deck : develop the second component of a slide deck to accompany the data product.

- Final Project Submission and Evaluation : submit the final project and classmates' work review
